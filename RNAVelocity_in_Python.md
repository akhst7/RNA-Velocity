# RNAVelocity Analysis by using Python libraries including Scanpy, ScVelo, and CellRank #
## Introduction ##
There are several R packages that deals with RNAVelocity related analyses such as pseudotime and lineagetrace, however, Python defintely has edges over R regarding these types of analyses.  There is a suite of Python packages including ```Scanpy, ScVelo, and CellRank``` that provide a computational basis for rather complicated and broader filed of the genomic biology.  

Similar to R, You can run Python straight in the terminal however, using Python IDE makes your life much easier. I used to use ```Jupyter lab``` but recently, I've made a switch to ```Positron```, an new multiplatform IDE developed by Posit.  It turns out that ```Positron``` can run R as well, and I thought I could run both Python and R at same time, side by side in the same UI instead of running separate Python and R IDEs, ```Jupyter lab``` and ```Rstudio``` respectively, x  Unfortunately however, ```Positron``` in its current form does not replace ```Rstudio```.  

A following does not cover installation of these Python packages, which are well described in their github sites.
