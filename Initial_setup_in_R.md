# RNA Velocity Analysis of Human HSCs scRNAseq data from Xuan_Zhang et.al
## Introduction

RNA velocity is used to provide aids in understanding dybamic states of cell differentiation, based on asscessing kinetics of spliced and unspliced RNA from clusters of cells that are defined by annotation of scRNAseq data.  It diplays direction as well as momentum of cellular differentiation, inferring potential development of immature to mature stages of groups of cells in question.   The original Nature article by ```Manno et.al.``` (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0414-6) describes theoretical basis and alogorithm of RNA velocity.
