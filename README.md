# RNA-Velocity
This repo contains my take on RNA Velocity analysis based on Human Bone Marrow scRNAseq data by Xu et. al. 
Due to the memory limitation of my local machine (M1 Ultra MacStudio), it was impossible to run the RNA velocity analysis by using a scvelo python package from the whole integrated data.  Instead, a single  scRNAseq data with the largest number of cells (WF26CD34) was chosen for the purpose of demostrating RNA velocity.
